This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Rust when iterating over an array using a loop and an index.  The provided `bug.rs` file showcases the error. The `bugSolution.rs` demonstrates the corrected version.  This example is useful for understanding and avoiding this type of error in Rust programs.  Note that Rust's built-in iterators generally handle array bounds checking more safely, so prefer them whenever possible.
